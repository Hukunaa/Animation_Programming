# Animation_Programming
This is a student project, coding bones and joints systems, the system can use loaded animations

On this project, i had an animation that had to be translated and played by a Animation system to acutally be seen on a model.
We coded the animation system, with its bones and joints manipulation, so that the animation can be used on the model
It can read animations to be played on a model
